## 5. Download R Script

The R script is a file with extension .r and contains the code to execute the program. 

- **Download script:**
  - You can download the R script [here](linreg.r).
  - Alternatively, download the R script from NTULearn. 

- **Execute program:**
  - Save the R script in a folder on your computer. 
  - In RStudio, set the working directory to the folder where you saved your script. You can do this by typing the following command in the Console, replacing "[pathname]" with the actual path to your folder:
    - setwd("path/to/your/folder")
  - Try running the R script by typing the following command in the Console:
    - source("linreg.r")
